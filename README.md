# My Leetcode Challenges
The JavaScript file in this repository contains all of my Leetcode functions that I have completed. I posted these so others can see my coding challenges, not so others can just copy and paste it into a Leetcode. I do one problem from Leetcode each day. I thought about making each one into a separate file, but this allows myself and others to search for specific methods and other code among all of the ones I have completed.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I have a full website attached that has the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I use for my Leetcode. In the JavaScript file, each problem is in a comment block and some comment blocks have some extra information noted in it about extra solutions or other related information regareding the question. After the comment block, is the code I submitted. Some have more than one solution that I made as well.

## Lessons Learned:
These are more fun than the Codewars problems because they are more challenging and expand on the data structures and methods that I use. However, I had to spend quite a bit more time researching before tackling some problems.
